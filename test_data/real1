"WHUT. ARE. YOU. WRITING? WHUT IS SO IMPORTANT? LET ME SEE. NO, GIVE IT, GIVE ME YOUR FUCKING—AGH!” Charli XCX is grinning, a drink in her hand, pushing my drink into my face, spilling vodka on us both as she tries to steal my iPhone. It’s sometime after midnight in a back room of Baby’s All Right, the South Williamsburg, Brooklyn club the 21-year-old has just shut down with a DJ set. Covered in sweat and alcohol, she has the phone in her hand, and types away furiously in my notes. “Put that in your article,” she laughs, shoving it back at me. She sashays out the door of the club, friends in tow, on her way to a victory cigarette.

I should’ve seen it coming. When we first met, 12 hours earlier, she approached me in the middle of her cover shoot and tapped my shoulder.

“Hi, I’m Charli,” she smiled, extending a palm out of her pink kimono, a plate of meat and potatoes—literally, just meat and potatoes—from a nearby catering tray in her other hand. “Want to chat a bit while this thing goes on?”

Ten minutes later, she starts telling me about her period. “I’m kind of obsessed with it right now,” she says, grinning. “Periods are really punk.” She’s sitting in a makeup chair in a sun-soaked photo studio in Williamsburg, having her hair taken out of rollers between setups. “I want to have tampons as merch that say ‘PERIODS ARE PUNK.’”

She mentions recording sessions she did in Sweden, where she went to record some of the hundreds of tracks she has stored away, a few of which she describes as punk songs (“two minutes long, not a lot of words”). If she were to release them and tour with them?

“I’d call it The Tampon Girls,” she laughs again. “That’s such a sick name for a punk band.”

Like most of the next 12 hours I’m about to spend with Charli XCX—the songwriter and featured voice on global pop smashes like Icona Pop’s “I Love It” and Iggy Azalea’s “Fancy,” songs so popular you’d have to be clinically deaf to not have heard them in the Western World by now—I know how we got here. But it’s still difficult to believe.

After all, artists in the highest echelons of the pop charts aren’t supposed to be this forthcoming, or frank. Or legitimately funny, charming, and disconcertingly brilliant. They’re not supposed to be anything, really, but popular. In 2014, pop music is dominated by people whose images are calibrated to precise degrees, either by their own designs or those of freakishly controlling label executives. Charli XCX has by and large been an outlier in that group of people. She’s almost universally a critical darling. She’s spent as much time behind the scenes—helping write other people’s massive, global smash songs, and delivering their hooks, too—as she’s spent in front of them.

That looks like it’s all about to change. Over the summer, the hazy, anthemic, disturbingly catchy "Boom Clap" became Charli's first song to power into the top spot on a Billboard chart. And having been the voice of the hook for that other song of the summer, from London to To-k-yo, it’s not entirely unfair to expect her new album (named with a knowing wink: Sucker) to finally catapult her into that upper stratosphere of fame, the one that Charli’s been under the bleachers of, maybe a little too cool for, until now.

Yet: she doesn’t aspire to the trappings of traditional pop stardom (“I fucking hate divas,” she snarls. “That’s the last thing I’d ever want to be. I don’t want to be a fucking asshole.”).

And she’s worth her word. At every opportunity, be it to a cab driver, a waitress, or an entire photo studio full of assistants, she thanks everybody sincerely. When we go to a concert and have trouble at the door, she doesn’t bark her name—or anyone’s name—at the doorman.

After midnight—at a point when she’s been running on about three hours of sleep for two days, during which she’s performed on Late Night With Seth Meyers and wrapped her Complex cover shoot—she in no way resembles a pop star in any traditional sense, let alone a manufactured one. This is after a turnt-up rap show, her DJ set, and getting an entire bar to do the Macarena with her, but before she makes out with some guy in the rain outside a bar, and before she and another nightcrawler send me a drunken, screaming voicemail. There are no red velvet ropes, no clubs with bottle service, no VIP areas. This is the kind of fun most pop stars sing about, but haven’t actually had in years. This is just a straight-up drunkass night out on the town.

This is also a Wednesday night, and all her idea. So, no: Charli XCX is not your traditional pop star.

Hailing from Stevenage, in Hertfordshire, England, about an hour north of London, Charlotte Emma Aitchison—the daughter of “super supportive” parents, a Scottish father and an Indian mother from Uganda—has music in her lineage.

Her father used to book shows for a small local venue, which may be why he struck a deal with Charli when she was 14 to support her music career with studio time. In five days, she recorded 12 songs, which became 14, her “debut” album that was used for promotional purposes but never actually pressed.

“I’m aware that when I talk about this in interviews I could come across as some spoiled rich kid who had Daddy’s money,” she quickly interjects. “My family is average. I didn’t have a crazy life as a kid.”

Tell that to her mother, who used to take teenage Charli to DJ warehouse raves in East London, where she was discovered. Consider the effort: “My mum was, like, standing next to people taking fuckloads of ketamine,” Charli smiles, wistfully. “Someone vomited on her shoes one time because they were in such a massive k-hole. And my mom looked after them.” Most parents would not do that.

As exciting as making 14 was, it wasn’t a perfect experience. “My label at that time was like, ‘We signed a youngin! We’re gonna make her a pop star,’” she laughs, presiding over a vodka-cranberry at the Brooklyn bistro Diner an hour after the shoot ends. The label wanted to craft her into a commodity.

She remembers being 16, in a label meeting: “They said, ‘You need to brush [your hair] if you want to sell records.’ I was like, ‘Are you. Fucking. Kidding me? Am I having this conversation with five 30-year-old men who are bald? This is ridiculous!’”

In short, it was soulless. “I felt like, is this it? Is this what I’ve signed up for? It was mechanical.”

But it wasn’t entirely a waste, either. “I’m glad that happened, because that told me exactly what I didn’t want to do,” she says.

Charli finished high school and after a year dropped out of the Slade School of Fine Art to focus on recording full-time. She signed with Asylum Records in 2010, and in June 2012 released an EP, You’re the One, featuring two studio singles and their respective remixes. She also released a mixtape, Heartbreaks and Earthquakes.

Heartbreaks features Charli singing over everything from Jai Paul to Blood Orange, interlaced with samples from Kill Bill and Cruel Intentions, among others. It’s a weird pastiche of ’90s sentimentality and distinctly of-the-moment music. You’re the One’s two singles, co-written with Patrik Berger (who’s worked with Lana Del Rey and Robyn) and Ariel Rechtshaid (the Grammy-winning producer who’s worked with everyone from Haim to Justin Bieber), demonstrate an acute self-awareness on Charli’s part: She started to refine the kinds of pop she wanted to make, and bring in master craftsmen to help her make it. This was around the time she started recording material for what eventually made up her major label debut album, True Romance. “You’re the One” was part of a package of beats Berger sent Charli.

The other was a song called “I Love It,” which would eventually be credited to Swedish duo Icona Pop, featuring Charli XCX. And with that one, Charli did what she always does: “I yelled [lyrics] into the computer for half an hour and never thought about it again.”

Only she did, because that song—the one about being a ’90s bitch, crashing cars, not caring, and loving it, the one that’s been heard everywhere from HBO’s Girls to Snooki & Jwoww to Sesame Street—did well. Platinum and gold worldwide well. And while Charli wrote it (and even sings the entire song with them on the track), she still only had second billing on it. And every interviewer, without fail, always asks her why she gave it away. Her answer is always the same: It wasn’t right for her, then. But the question is a weird one, as though it’s inconceivable that she could be seen as a songwriting talent.

What bothers her more is what transpired during and after the success of “I Love It,” for which she provided guest vocals. She witnessed “how people can change” after a hit song, “how it can suddenly turn from being super fun and cool and everyone’s happy to it just…”—she sighs—“becoming a wall.”

She’s clear that the problem wasn’t with Icona Pop but between herself and ominous “management.” “I got shut out of the process and pushed away from that song,” she says, sinking further into the corner booth. “I didn’t get the credit I deserved.”

Charli started to hate the music industry again. At recording sessions, she heard the same thing over and over again—execs wanted another hit. She impersonates the faceless suits: “We want ‘I Love It’ meets ‘212.’ Replicate this!”

She suddenly leans back into the table: “I can’t do that! I can’t replicate it because I genuinely have no idea how I wrote that song.”

Charli’s songwriting process is astoundingly spontaneous and reactive: Listening to a beat for the first time, she sings and records whatever comes out. Sometimes there are additional takes, but not always.

There’s a distinctly electric, kinetic quality to “I Love It,” the hook to “Fancy,” and “Boom Clap”—they’re built for parties and mixtapes, totally singable anthems. Incredibly, when lacking anything remotely resembling self-consciousness, Charli XCX produces hits that resonate around the world. But what about her more deliberate, self-conscious efforts?

True Romance, released in April 2013, didn’t have any hits, per se. The album had catchy songs about relationships destroyed and young, dumb love—common pop wheelhouse stuff. It was the packaging that set her album apart to its vocal admirers, many of whom were music critics. Lush, dreamy soundscapes and bedroom-ceiling musings with the coolest girl in school, finely produced to a tee, with each note exuding Charli’s naturally charismatic, smart edges. Maybe too smart. The album was a critical success, but despite building Charli’s devoted following, it struggled commercially, never cracking the Billboard 200. She loves True Romance but admits to making music in a way she’s not entirely proud of: “I just wanted to make sure people thought I was cool,” she says. “That’s what I was worried about.”

It shows. In a late 2012 dustup, a few months before True Romance dropped, the lead singer of indie pop group Elite Gymnastics penned a Tumblr post, writing off Charli XCX as a product of an industrial pop music complex. It finished by calling her a “mangled, grotesque approximation” of fellow female act Grimes, alongside whom she’d posed on the cover of a magazine a few months prior. The critique clearly hit hard. Charli penned a sincere, earnest response, explaining that she’d been working her ass off, and pledging to never respond to that kind of thing again.

At Diner, when asked about encountering this critique of her identity as a female performer who writes her own music, she goes off:

“There’s always a catch. Like: ‘Does she really do that? I heard her mum wrote that song.’ I read that about Lorde. I’m like: As if! Just because she’s young and successful, why is someone trying to take that away from her? It’s because she’s highly intelligent and a female who’s killing it. She’s doing something different, and people are afraid of that.” And then there are the inevitable comparisons, not to other pop songwriters—not to Weezer’s Rivers Cuomo or Vampire Weekend’s Rostam Batmanglij, both of whom Charli’s worked with on her new album—but to other female pop stars. “Just ’cause we all have vaginas doesn’t mean that we all play against each other. We’re all doing our own thing.”

And that thing is clearly working. It also involves more than fixating on these ideas. After all, Charli’s Tumblr response is still there. The one that provoked it, however, has since been deleted.
