t an awful week for the culture that surrounds and influences video games.

Last week, a game designer’s personal life was exposed to the internet, and used to justify physical threats to both the developer and her colleagues. The designer was one of many people targeted in an orchestrated harassment effort directed at game developers.

On Friday, harassers hacked game designer Phil Fish’s Twitter account and website. Fish, at least briefly, contemplated selling his company and leaving the industry altogether.

On Sunday, a fake bomb threat from a hacker group diverted the flight of Sony Online Entertainment president John Smedley.

That day, the same hacker group claimed responsibility for shutting down Sony’s PlayStation Network. According to an official earnings forecast, an attack that shut down the same network in 2011 and lasted for days cost the company $170 million.

On Monday, prominent media critic Anita Sarkeesian posted a video to YouTube that criticized the use of women as background decoration, particularly in violent and sexual ways.

Many of those who shared the post received threats and harassment. The following tweets were directed at game designer Tim Schafer on Tuesday and Wednesday.
